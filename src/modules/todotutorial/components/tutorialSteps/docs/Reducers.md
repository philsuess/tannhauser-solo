# Reducer: State â‡’ State

Finally, we need to specify how an action transforms State. Think of it as exactly this: you get a State
and an action and produce a new State. That happens in the `reducer`. It checks which action
might have been supplied and produces another state based on this. The
following code has nothing to do with our TodoApp, it's only to illustrate some shorthand notation.

```
return {
  ...state,
  currentStep: state.currentStep + 1,
};
```

Read "Return the current state only with the field `currentStep` updated, namely incremented by one".

typescript-fsa helps us out tremendously at this point, as we can just ask it to check for the type of the
action supplied. Check out the reference implementation and the use of the `isType` function.

If there is a payload (i.e. parameters to the action), you can simply get it from the redux Action:

```
if (isType(action, actions.todoInputChanged)) {
  return {
    ...state,
    currentTodoInput: action.payload,
  };
}
```

Here you can see how to get at the payload of the action.

Now finish the App!
